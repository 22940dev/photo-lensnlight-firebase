He used to have a small digi-cam with him back then, without being worried about the number of photos can be taken and camera rolls to be put, He started his saga of clicking. Initially, it was great fun capturing moments, people, beautiful scenery and everything around. Slowly perspective seeped in, he started taking photos with a feeling and sense. Now he wanted his photos to tell a story. That's how his interest, his passion, his hobby became his new found everlasting love. Photography became a way for him to express his feelings, his thoughts. Finally, he found something that he could call his own.",
