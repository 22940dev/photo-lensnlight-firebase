    "sahoo.desc": "I used to love clicking, from my childhood, holding my camera was great fun. I used to have a small Digi-Cam in my hands, without being worried about the number of photos can be taken and camera rolls to be put, I started my saga of clicking. Initially, it was great fun capturing moments, people, beautiful scenery and everything around. Slowly perspective seeped in, I started taking photos with a feeling and sense. Now I wanted my photos to tell a story. That's how my interest, my passion, my hobby became my new found everlasting love. Photography became a way for me to express my feelings, my thoughts. Finally, I found something that I could call my own.",
